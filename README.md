# Alien Symbolic Interpreter

A prototype CLI tool to explore a hypothetical "language of shapes" for cosmic signals, as proposed in the article ["The Language of Shapes: A New Approach to Cosmic Signals"](https://medium.com/@pedro.pissarra/the-language-of-shapes-a-new-approach-to-cosmic-signals-41b27f34a1d1).

## Purpose
This tool simulates a symbolic language where shapes represent physical and existential concepts, inspired by phenomena like quantum entanglement, cosmic inflation, and real signals like the Wow! Signal and FRBs. Itâ€™s a proof-of-concept to provoke reflection among scientists about alternative ways to interpret cosmic signals.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements**: Python 3.x
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedrogabrielpissarra/alien-symbolic-interpreter.git
   cd alien-symbolic-interpreter
